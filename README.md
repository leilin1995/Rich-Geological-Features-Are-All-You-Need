# Abstract
Identifying geological structures from seismic images is a critical step in understanding the Earth's evolutionary history, assessing geological disasters, and predicting resource distribution.  Recently, the robust capabilities for big data processing and nonlinear modeling offered by deep learning have led to its widespread attention in seismic structure identification. To avoid the extensive effort and resources required for manual labeling of seismic data, researchers have used synthetic seismic data with structure labels generated by numerical simulation to train deep learning models. However, these studies are task-oriented, simplifying and ignoring some common and important geological features during the simulation process, which limits the performance of the model on specific datasets. To further improve the generality and flexibility of deep learning models for structure identification on datasets with complex structural features, we propose a parametric 3D structure modeling framework for the numerical simulation of synthetic seismic data that include dip, fold, unconformity, channel, cave, salt body, and composite fault structure. Moreover, we revise some simulation solutions to make the simulated geological structures closer to the real ones. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the synthetic seismic dataset with the richest structural features to date. Applications of fault identification on several synthetic and field seismic datasets reveal that the deep learning model trained on datasets with limited geological features is prone to learn biased representations, which can cause the model to misclassify unseen geological structures with similar seismic responses to the target structure. The deep learning model trained on our proposed dataset significantly reduces the false positive rate of structures with similar seismic responses and improves the fault identification accuracy on datasets with complex geological features. Although this study focuses only on fault identification, the proposed synthetic seismic dataset can be easily adapted to identify other structural types.
